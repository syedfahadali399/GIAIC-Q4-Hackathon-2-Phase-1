# Todo App Constitution

## Vision

Build an in-memory Python console-based Todo application following spec-driven development principles using Claude Code.

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-First Development

Every feature must have a specification before implementation. Code is generated by Claude Code from specifications. Manual coding is strictly prohibited.

**Rationale**: Ensures deliberate design, maintainability, and alignment with project goals. Specifications serve as contracts that guide implementation and enable automated code generation.

### II. Agent-Driven Architecture

Use Claude Code subagents for specialized tasks. Each agent has a single, well-defined responsibility. Agents communicate through clear interfaces.

**Rationale**: Promotes separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability. Single-responsibility agents are easier to reason about, test, and compose into complex workflows.

### III. Incremental Development

Start with basic features (Add, View, Delete). Progress to intermediate features (Update, Mark Complete). Advance to organization features (Priority, Tags, Search, Sort).

**Rationale**: Reduces risk, enables early validation, and maintains momentum. Each increment delivers value and provides learning to inform subsequent phases.

**Development Stages**:
- **Basic Level**: Add, View, Delete tasks
- **Intermediate Level**: Update, Mark Complete
- **Advanced Level**: Priority, Tags, Search, Sort, Filtering

### IV. Code Quality Standards

Clean, readable Python code is mandatory. Proper error handling required for all user interactions. User-friendly console interface with clear prompts and feedback. Type hints where applicable to improve code clarity and catch errors early.

**Non-Negotiable Requirements**:
- All functions must handle errors gracefully with meaningful messages
- User input validation before processing
- Consistent formatting and naming conventions
- Type hints for function signatures
- Docstrings for non-trivial functions

### V. Data Management

In-memory storage using Python data structures (lists, dictionaries). No external database dependencies. Data persists only during application runtime.

**Rationale**: Simplifies Phase I implementation, eliminates deployment dependencies, and focuses development effort on core application logic rather than infrastructure.

**Constraints**:
- Use native Python data structures only
- No file I/O in Phase I
- No third-party persistence libraries
- Clear data model design that could support future persistence

## Development Workflow

### Specification Phase
1. Feature requirements documented in `specs/<feature>/spec.md`
2. Acceptance criteria defined with testable conditions
3. User stories capture intended behavior
4. Specification reviewed before planning

### Planning Phase
1. Architecture decisions documented in `specs/<feature>/plan.md`
2. Agent responsibilities defined
3. Interface contracts specified
4. Dependencies identified

### Task Generation Phase
1. Actionable tasks created in `specs/<feature>/tasks.md`
2. Tasks include acceptance tests
3. Dependency order established
4. Clear completion criteria for each task

### Implementation Phase
1. Claude Code generates code from specifications
2. Red-Green-Refactor cycle for each task
3. Incremental validation and testing
4. Manual coding is prohibited - only specification updates allowed

## Success Criteria

### Feature Completeness
- ✅ All Basic Level features implemented and tested
- ✅ All Intermediate Level features implemented and tested
- ✅ Features work together cohesively

### Quality Gates
- ✅ Console interface is intuitive and user-friendly
- ✅ Application handles errors gracefully with helpful messages
- ✅ Code is readable with consistent style
- ✅ Type hints present in all function signatures

### Process Compliance
- ✅ Code is generated entirely through Claude Code (no manual coding)
- ✅ All features have specifications before implementation
- ✅ Agent-driven architecture followed throughout

## Governance

### Constitutional Authority

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. All code generation, feature implementations, and process decisions must comply with the principles and standards defined herein.

### Amendment Process

1. **Proposal**: Changes must be documented with clear rationale
2. **Impact Analysis**: Assess effect on existing specifications, plans, and tasks
3. **Version Update**: Follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
   - MAJOR: Backward-incompatible principle changes or removals
   - MINOR: New principles added or material expansions
   - PATCH: Clarifications, wording improvements, non-semantic refinements
4. **Template Sync**: Update all dependent templates in `.specify/templates/`
5. **Migration Plan**: For breaking changes, provide clear upgrade path

### Compliance Review

- All specifications must reference relevant constitutional principles
- All planning artifacts must verify alignment with agent-driven architecture
- All task definitions must follow incremental development stages
- All implementations must meet code quality standards

### Enforcement

Violations of constitutional principles require either:
1. **Specification Update**: Revise the spec to comply with constitution
2. **Constitutional Amendment**: If principle is no longer valid, amend constitution formally
3. **Implementation Correction**: Regenerate code through Claude Code to meet standards

### Development Guidance

For runtime development guidance, agents should reference:
- `CLAUDE.md` for agent-specific execution rules
- `.specify/templates/` for artifact structure
- `history/prompts/` for prior decision context
- `history/adr/` for architectural rationale
