## Prompt

# Todo App Constitution - Phase I

## Vision
Build an in-memory Python console-based Todo application following spec-driven development principles using Claude Code.

## Core Principles

### 1. Spec-First Development
- Every feature must have a specification before implementation
- Code is generated by Claude Code from specifications
- Manual coding is strictly prohibited

### 2. Agent-Driven Architecture
- Use Claude Code subagents for specialized tasks
- Each agent has a single, well-defined responsibility
- Agents communicate through clear interfaces

### 3. Incremental Development
- Start with basic features (Add, View, Delete)
- Progress to intermediate features (Update, Mark Complete)
- Advance to organization features (Priority, Tags, Search, Sort)

### 4. Code Quality Standards
- Clean, readable Python code
- Proper error handling
- User-friendly console interface
- Type hints where applicable

### 5. Data Management
- In-memory storage using Python data structures
- No external database dependencies
- Data persists only during application runtime

## Success Criteria
- All Basic Level features implemented
- All Intermediate Level features implemented
- Console interface is intuitive and user-friendly
- Application handles errors gracefully
- Code is generated entirely through Claude Code

## Response snapshot

Created the Todo App Constitution v1.0.0 at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` with the following structure:

1. **Vision**: In-memory Python console-based Todo application with spec-driven development
2. **Core Principles** (5 total):
   - I. Spec-First Development - Code generated from specifications, manual coding prohibited
   - II. Agent-Driven Architecture - Subagents with single responsibilities
   - III. Incremental Development - Progressive stages (Basic → Intermediate → Advanced)
   - IV. Code Quality Standards - Python best practices, error handling, type hints
   - V. Data Management - In-memory storage, no external dependencies

3. **Development Workflow**: Specification → Planning → Task Generation → Implementation phases
4. **Success Criteria**: Feature completeness, quality gates, process compliance
5. **Governance**: Constitutional authority, amendment process, compliance review, enforcement

Template consistency validation:
- ✅ spec-template.md - Aligned with spec-first principle and incremental user stories
- ✅ plan-template.md - Aligned with agent-driven architecture and constitution checks
- ✅ tasks-template.md - Aligned with incremental development stages and user story organization

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Established foundational governance for Todo App project with clear spec-driven development principles
- 🧪 Tests: None (constitutional document)
- 📁 Files: Created constitution.md with version 1.0.0, validated template alignment
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.specify` to create first feature specification (Basic Level: Add, View, Delete)
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution provides clear guardrails for agent-driven development with explicit prohibition of manual coding and requirement for specifications before implementation

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - initial constitution establishment successful
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All placeholders resolved, templates validated, governance rules established
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A - Standard constitution establishment
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Create Basic Level feature specification following Principle III (Incremental Development)
